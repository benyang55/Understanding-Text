I find that if you let it get just a bit frozen like a soft slurpee/slushee it is really good or just very very cold will work. I have seen some ppl post very negative remarks on here & think some may be exaggerating just a bit & some may not really know what to expect from a drink like this...nothing wrong with that just dont be so dramatic about it really. One thing I have found a GREAT use for this with is Jamba Juice now sells frozen packs of it tops selling smoothies in stores now, so I like to buy my favorite Mango a go go & use the mango/peach coconut juice to blend the smoothie instead of using the apple juice that it calls for...you could use any of the vita water favors to mix with any of the flavors. Instead of hating something try mixing it with something else & finding ways to create a healthy drink. Bottom line I love it.",

I opened one of the containers and took a swig immediately as I opened the box. Ugh! The mango aftertaste in this drink is the worst of the different mango flavors. It overpowers both the coconut and peach flavors. I can't even taste the peach in the drink. I let it chill to see if the aftertaste would go away, but was not so lucky. The flavor that overpowers everything is what you get when you leave the peeled mango out in the open for a day or two. It's way past ripe going to starting to get rancid. I put several other containers in the fridge to chill. I got the same results. It's a bummer because I was looking forward to drinking it. The version with pineapple is much much better than this one. I still like the straight coconut water drink the best. It tastes just like the fresh coconuts that my family used to cut down from the palms and drink with a straw.",

I've paid as low as $13, and as high as $20, and guess what?

I saw this add on Facebook for Coconut Water and saw that it has the same amount of potassium as V-8. I bought a pack and have been drinking it for about a week. According the the reviews the pineapple seemed to be a big hit so I went with that. It tastes exactly like you would imagine a mixture of coconut and pineapple. I can't say I'm in love with it but it is 100% better than choking down the V-8. I have actually drank this every night after my workout for the hydration and potassium benefits.

When I handed them to him, he looked at me like I had gone nuts, but what he said to me after his event sold me forever. He said, \"Mom, I felt better during this race than I ever have before! I felt like I was flying, with energy to spare! I could run it all over again!\" I've decided to keep healthy fruit and nut based protein bars and coconut water around from now on! I will admit, though, that neither of my sons actually \"likes\" the taste of it. They think it tastes funny, but I figure it's because of the sugary \"electrolyte\" drinks they've become accustomed to.

Beyond that, I can't help but wonder how rum would go with it because it has such a tropical taste. It's only a matter of time until it's used in bars and clubs.

I wanted to give Amazon a try since the price of S&S was cheaper than my local Whole Foods. Unfortunately, the first and second batches I received had the same issues. Even with the screw cap. They would be a hit or miss. Some would smell like rotten fish, others would be clear and be perfectly fine. I drink these on a daily basis, and after a week both my girlfriend and I got food poisoning that required both of us to go to the ER to be put on IV's. When I contacted Vita Coco support, I got the same run around that \"We appreciate your feedback but there is nothing we can do about your shipment and you should contact the retailer.\" Thanks for standing behind your products Vita Coco. I had to contact Amazon support and they were able to refund me the amounts. I'm throwing all of these out and canceling my subscription.",

I should have known better after ordering and throwing out a couple cases of the Plain Vita-Coco coconut water. It's terrible in any flavor as it turns out. I figured out why it's so nasty - Brazilian coconuts. I threw out 2 cases of the plain, 2 cases of this flavor, 2 cases of the pineapple, and 2 of another. At $20/case that's $160 wasted. ZICO(5/5) - (Coconuts from Thailand) is by far the best-tasting coconut water ... just like out of a real coconut. I love it plain or with Mango or Passion Fruit. Naked(3/5) and O.N.E.(4/5) have too little flavor but are still drinkable and refreshing. Vita-Coco has some weird gross taste. I can't find one thing to compare it to, though. It's literally undrinkable.",

You can get crazy and have a bit of fun using them instead of Tonic or Soda water if you know what I mean. They also are full of potassium which seems to \"cure\" the morning after a bit of partying.

But I've read how healthy is it, how it helps naturally with electrolyte balance and all that, and being on diuretics for my heart, I am always low in electrolytes, even with taking supplements my doctor prescribes for me. So I decided to try this coconut water because it was flavored. I'll admit the flavor helps make it palatable, but I still don't really like it by itself. BUT I've learned that if I put it in a smoothie with fresh fruit and veggies or add it to a veggie or fruit juice, I don't really even notice it or it adds a nice sweetness that I don't mind. I've also frozen it as ice cubes and added it to smoothies that way, to make them slushy and cold. It works beautifully, adds a little flavor that regular ice cubes or water wouldn't, but still gives me all the good electrolytes I'm wanting! It's a perfect solution and the easy-open little packages are recyclable, so I pop them in our recycle bin when I'm done. Easy peasy and healthy!",

Is the coconut flavor strong? Not really. But then again this is coconut water, if you want a more in your face flavor then coconut milk is what you're after. Can you taste the pineapple? Yes, but its going to be a bright note mixed in with the mellowness of the coconut water. The best way to serve it is cold and shaken well. I stick it in the freezer until it gets slushy and then shake it hard. That way even when it starts to melt, you still have a chilled drink to sip on. As to the reviewer who said there where white bits floating in their product, I never drank from a clear container but the ingredients list does say coconut water, pineapple puree, coconut puree, and vitamin c. So the white bits can be attributed to one of those, if the expiration date is fine (and those are usually more than generous) and it doesn't smell/taste like something's rotten in Denmark than everything should be fine. It even says on the bottle that since its made from natural ingredients there may be a variation in color and taste. It did taste a bit salty when I drank my first bottle, but I don't think I shook it either. I don't think the drink is going to be for everybody, it took a couple of tries before it grew on me and the only reason I started was because I'm trying to cut out sugary drinks but not ready to drink mostly water.",

Our body loves this stuff just as much as we do...without all that fructose, sucrose, and whatchamacallit preservative additive stuff in so many products today. I love the plain coconut water as it has less calories and gives me the boost I need. Just check out the ingredient list...coconut water...that's it!!! Gee I sound like a commercial :-/. Anyway, the fact that it's low in calories and offers the potassium and electrolites we need just seals the deal for us. Oh the other thing I noticed when comparing products is vitacoco uses ACTUAL fruit puree unlike the other brand that uses fruit essence...what is fruit \"essence\" anyway??? And if you've never had coconut water, it doesn't taste like cococut meat. It's more earthy and subtle. And if you're squimish on taste and picky, I recommend my husband's favorite flavor, Pineapple. That one is coconut water with pineapple and coconut meat puree...it tastes like a refreshing PinaColda :-). He absolutely LOVES it...I do too, but it has a little more calories (110 cal) and a little fat (2.5g), whereas the plain coconut water has only 60cal and 0 fat, yes, zero :-). BTW, my husband is an avid runner who logs around 45+ miles a week and is always looking for a good drink to rehydrate and recoop after a long run. Since this stuff isn't cheap, around $1.50 a shot, he saves it for his longest runs and drinks nestle quick chocolate skim milk for his shorter runs...but the coconut water is by far his favorite treat. Besure to chill it before drinking...not very refreshing warm :-p. For the reviewer who didn't like it, feel free to send your case to us, we'll drink it :-).",

I now drink one before I leave on any type of excursion in the sun like biking, kayaking, etc. and so far it seems to have helped. I also happen to love the taste, I find it really light and refreshing but I will caution you to try it before ordering a case of it. I've had many friends taste it and they did not see how I could even drink it! So, it's all a matter of preference... Even my 12yr old son swipes these from me, but keep in mind that we're not accustomed to sweet drinks and usually drink unsweetened iced teas or water.

I tried several brands and in the end, I believe it had the better taste of them all. I compared Goya (awful) and Naked brand. Naked was a very close second, but overall, the price and availability of VitaCoco, plus the slightly better taste was a total win. The water taste like a young, fresh coconut on the verge of starting to develop the 'jelly' on the inside. What I would describe as slightly 'green'. Green doesn't mean tasting like an unripe banana, just that it is missing that slightly sweeter hint of a perfect coconut, one that has about 1/8 - 1/4 inch of gelatinous coconut flesh on the inside. Well before the stage of getting that hard, white coconut 'meat'. The flavor is quite consistent across cases. I still rate it 5 stars, even though I wish it had that slightly more perfected flavor of the perfect coconut. Perhaps there are packaging reasons this cannot be achieved. In the meantime, I get to enjoy my island beverage of choice, and even use it as a mixer at times. Lovely.",

The pineapple flavor made the coconut water taste a little sour, while the plain variety has just the right amount of sweetness mixed in with the taste of electrolytes. My only complaints are with the price and packaging. If you don't catch this on a good sale, it can be a bit pricey. Also, the Tetra Pak bottle makes it almost impossible to get the last teaspoon. I look like an idiot with my head to the sky shaking a Vita Coco attached to my mouth just to get the last few drops.

If at home I got a coconut that tastes like this from a vendor I'd not go back to that vendor again. In the US it is a bit more difficult though because we're dealing with packaged/bottled coconut water so is never going to taste super fresh. But for many reviewers, maybe this is just what coconut water tastes like to them, hence all the good reviews.

Figured it out i think... it has 100% of your daily vitamin C, while zico has zero. The vitamin C is added, which i think is what gives it a little bit of 'zip' to balance a bit of the buttery smoothness (blandness) of the coco water.

I have been drinking coco water for years without really knowing it was great for you...and I mean really great for you. I just liked the semi sweet refreshing taste and was readily available where I normally was. Recently, as I age and became more interested in healthy foods, I belatedly found out how great these waters were for you. In fact, in World War II, the soldiers sometimes used coco waters for blood plasma transfusions as the minerals in coco were so closely matched to the needs of a human being. Anyways, possibly due to the increasing demand, this brand comes from several countries in my consumption experience - Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia. I find I like the Philippines and Indonesian ones the best tasting but that's just my preference for a sweeter taste. I highly recommend you give this a try.",

A lot of other brands either from concentrate or taste a bit off. It tastes fine both room temperature and refrigerated. I have only tried the pure coconut water flavor. I purchased the 11.1 Ounce Containers in a pack of 12. They arrived on time and in a cute box with a lid that I used to store them. I have no problem with the container or the plastic drinking attachment. Drinking coconut water has a lot of positive properties. Having drank mostly Vita Coco when seeking these benefits, I can honestly say that I am a huge fan. It works. Whenever I come home from a hot, dry day, a few sips soothe my throat and re-energizes me. During the day, it keeps me more hydrated than an entire bottle of water. The only reason I'm giving this product a review of 4/5 stars is because for a few containers I experienced leakage. This occurred when the product is more than half-way finished and some water would leak out between the box container and the plastic lip. I can only assume that the glue securing the attachment was either not strong enough of the water softens the container enough to loosen its grip. Either way, this shouldn't happen. I have purchased the same exact product from Costco and that never happened once. I'm not exactly sure why this happens, but when it does, I just rip it completely off and drink straight from the box. This isn't a huge problem for me personally, but I hope it doesn't happen again when I buy my next batch.",

I also buy it for my breast-feeding sister, who has trouble staying hydrated. I tried all different brands and flavors, and this one is by far the best.

I'm not sure how you can claim a product is 100% pure coconut water when you have added something to it.

I fill my sports bottle either 1/4 or 1/2 way with coconut water and the rest with filtered water. At the gym it gives me more bang for my buck and it seems to SOOTHE MY TUMMY. Water often gives me a tummy ache. I can drink less volume and get more endurance. However, I had been drinking the O.N.E. brand. I just got this brand with Amazon (vito coco) and I am disappointed in the taste. It tastes so bad that I thought I got a bad batch, but in ordering more, I see it is the brand. Where the O.N.E. brand went down easy, this VC brand makes me pucker. I don't know why. You would think coconut water is all the same right?

Now maybe it's a \"placebo\" effect, but I know from spending some time in India, along the rural roads going from city to city, people will stop off the side of the road and purchase fresh coconuts that the vendor has chopped the top off of and refresh their bodies by sticking a straw in the opening and consuming the liquid. My friend who lived their (he just moved to Saudi Arabia) told me that coconut water helps the body fight off the effects of the heat and refreshes the individual when they spend a day in the sun and heat. Well millions of people from India can't be wrong! I find that it helps me as a sport drink and I don't have to worry about the salt. Like I said, I may just be psyching myself into believing it or it really is benefitting me. All I know is I definitely feel better, refreshed and when in the heat, much more able to stave off the solar effects. You know, even if their was no health benefit, I would be drawn to drink it because I am a sucker for what tastes good. The bodily benefits are a real pleasant \"plus\" which does not always happen when consuming something that we think tastes good enough to be a \"guilty pleasure\". I've also heard that this brand does not take the water from several different cocnuts from different locations and \"mix\" them together to try to make it taste good. What you get is the real thing, not a concentrate that is rehydrated. Oh well, treat yourself and do your own experiments and see if you feel better having this drink in your daily diet. Medically speaking, some people have the notion that because coconut \"meat\" (the white stuff in the coconut) is high in fat and cholesterol that this product might have those negative effects. In reality, when drinking coconut WATER, (not COCONUT MILK -that's for cooking, primarily), as I was saying before interrupting myself, COCONUT WATER actually LOWERS bad cholesterol. Pretty cool! Have fun with your own exploration. PS: One of my friends thinks a carton of the drink would taste great as a mixer with a shot of rum in it. (or a little less than shot.) That will have to wait till I get back from Jamaica with another bottle of that fine drink - yum!!",

The ones from Costco have a refreshing sweet taste. Now I understand what he meant by the ones from Amazon taste funny -- simpley like cooked sugarcane juice - a little stale but cooked sugarcane juice is not too bad if you don't know how good coconut juice supposed to taste like, right? Anyone of you bought this from Amazon should try to find a bottom from the grocery store or Costco for comparison. If you never had a good one, you won't know what is bad. I was happy with it before I get to tried ones from Costco and that's why I even bought a second case. Now, I have reason to suspect the 2 cases I bought, a month apart between the 2 cases, were both expired or maybe bootlegged. Since we already finished (yuck, how we do it?) from Amazon and threw away the containers, I have no way of know if they were expired or bootlegged (or perhaps not stored properly). I do remember the color of the ones from Amazon being darker than those from Costco although the box and packaging are identical.

I would give it five stars if they would take out the added fructose. WOULD I RECOMMEND IT? * Yes, but with a caveat.

The ones from Costco have a refreshing sweet taste. Now I understand what he meant by the ones from Amazon taste funny -- simpley like cooked sugarcane juice - a little stale but cooked sugarcane juice is not too bad if you don't know how good coconut juice supposed to taste like, right? Anyone of you bought this from Amazon should try to find a bottom from the grocery store or Costco for comparison. If you never had a good one, you won't know what is bad. I was happy with it before I get to tried ones from Costco and that's why I even bought a second case. Now, I have reason to suspect the 2 cases I bought, a month apart between the 2 cases, were both expired or maybe bootlegged. Since we already finished (yuck, how we do it?) from Amazon and threw away the containers, I have no way of know if they were expired or bootlegged (or perhaps not stored properly).

I saw some other reviews noting poor quality when the product originated in Thailand rather than Brazil.

Clearly this is a common problem with this product. I've learned my lesson and so should you: the moral of this review is that if you want to buy Vita Coco, you are probably better getting it from a local grocery store than from Amazon. Or better still, avoid this product. Of course, if urine luck you may get the good stuff, but why play roulette with your beverage order?

So I decided to stop waiting and give a try to the competition and that's it, I'm not buying Naked anymore and staying with Vita Coco. I agree with some of the comments saying Vita doesn't taste as close to Coconut water as it should, and I agree with them: This is an improvement over real coconut water, it taste better; if you read my review of Naked, you will understand. I'm not a Coconut Water Tasting Expert if such thing exists, but I grew up drinking coconut water straight from the coconut, and the only thing I didn't like was that bitter/salty after taste, which Vita removed almost completely. This makes it a bit sweeter and in my opinion it is a good thing Vita's packaging is also easier to drink from, the plastic neck really help to drink it right from the container if you want, no need for straws or having to pour it into a glass. It also carries a better price, they are more honest about what at the end is just coconut water, something readily available in nature, just nicely packaged and more convenient",

Instead, I use coconut water as one of the ingredients in my breakfast smoothie. (The other liquid ingredients are orange juice and soy milk.) The amount of coconut water per smoothie is 1/2 cup. I've used Vita Coco for over a year, and the quality has been consistent. On one occasion, I received a damaged box and one of the bottles inside had a broken seal. But I've never gotten sealed product that turned out to be spoiled. Vita Coco doesn't have a \"use within x days of opening\" advisory on its label. This might be because the manufacturer adds citric acid. (Listed as \"Vitamin C\" on the ingredient list). In my experience, Vita Coco lasts 4-5 days after opening without any noticeable degradation. Besides citric acid, the manufacturer adds \"1% fruit sugar\". (There are flavored versions of Vita Coco that contain other ingredients as well.) Different brands and flavors have varying amounts of sugar. Like most other coconut water products, Vita Coco comes in (biodegradable?) cartons with twist-on caps. These box-like cartons topped with small plastic spouts aren't designed for smooth pouring. There's one brand (Zico?) that comes in plastic bottles instead. These make for better pouring. My primary reason for sticking with Vita Coco has been the consistent quality. That makes it a pretty good value for the price. Also, I think it tastes pretty good for a shelf-stable coconut water product. And the flavored versions offer especially broad appeal for kids and coconut water newbies. I give this product 4.5 stars. (But I'll round up to 5, since I'm not expecting it to taste like fresh coconut water.)

I am often on-the-go and so I need something that can easily transport. The taste is good and it really has no sugar in it. I had tried some Dole Pineapple juice a few days earlier and it was just too sweet for my taste. It's refreshing & also has a good taste. Highly recommend!",

It's not as good as the water that came from the fresh cracked coconuts in St. Lucia, but it's a good enough way to get it at home.",

We make the YCK (Young Coconut Kefir) from probiotic starters and the juice - the water from YOUNG coconuts. This is a very important part of the diet as many people find that it helps tremendously to help them with their sugar & carb cravings and helps to restore the gut's inner ecobalance by recolonizing the gut with healthy beneficial probiotics. Sometimes finding fresh young white THAI coconuts is a challenge. If you do find them, like other fresh produce, they can be old and mildewy or they can cost a fortune since there is a wide range price on them (.69 cents to $5.00 EACH). Because the juice content varies between each coconut (think of a juicy apple vs a drier apple), it can take a person 1-3 fresh coconuts to make 1 quart of young coconut kefir. That's where these wonderful pre-packaged containers full of young coconut water come in handy for those of us who love Young Coconut Kefir! Although packaged coconut water does not taste as sweet and fresh as FRESH young coconut water, it still tastes good, is very refreshing, contains MORE electolytes (especially potassium) than any sports drink out there, is all natural and of course, is SO easy to access by pulling the 'sticky tab' back rather than cracking a hard fresh coconut by hand! Not to mention they keep longer than fresh coconuts. Young Coconut water is a GREAT and much HEALTHIER alternative to any sports drink, juice drink full of unhealthy syrups such as high fructose corn syrup and especially sodas. They taste much better cold and is even more refreshing with some freshly squeezed lime juice in them.",

The taste is unlike anything I've ever tried before and it goes well with all types of foods. It hydrates you with 100% natural coconut water, leaving you refreshed and delighted at the same time. The tetra packs are great on the go (perfect for taking to the gym, to work, on a run, on a walk, etc) and contain an adequate amount of coconut water. I'd highly recommend Vita Coco to anyone who is hesitant about trying coconut water for the first time.

Green coconuts just don't have that. The flavor is more, well, green and only very lightly sweet.

When I found out it was available through subscribe and save, I subscribed to the product thinking I was going to get the same quality as I normally do plus saving time and money. We've gone through 2 boxes from Amazon and there is a noticeable difference in quality. I have read some reviews that mentioned there was a quality issue but decided to try it anyway. This may or may not be Amazon's fault. Quality really has a lot to do with the country it is being produced in. I check the bottle every single time I drink them now, I have seen Mexico, Brazil, Sri Lanka, and Philippines. So far, Brazil is by far the best tasting. These two boxes that came from Amazon were both produced in Sri Lanka. The juice was not as clear and had more of a yellow tinge. It also had more of a syrupy consistency.

So when I saw this, I had to have it. Before my Amazon delivery came, I purchased some from my Whole Foods market in the neighborhood. The one I bought from Whole Foods was so delicious - just like the water straight from a fresh coconut. However, when I received my Amazon order of the Vita Coco - it was sour and not very tasty. I won't return it as it will cost too much to ship back, but definitely buy this from a market, not online. The difference is night and day. Vita Coco makes a great product, but only when it's fresh.",

Update:- March 11th 2017 - All of the five boxes I had ordered were spoiled or close to spoil. I ordered one more later on and it is back to its original taste.

It's personally my favorite type of coconut water. Coconut water is a favorite amongst runners and other athletes for its electrolytes and even popular amongst they non-athletes like myself. If you are wanting to try different coconut waters, I would recommend getting this one and another one to compare. The others tend to be more watery and have a stronger coconut flavor, whereas Vita Coco has a thicker, milkier like texture with a taste that's unique and hard to describe. I've noted that a few reviewers said they have received a bad patch of product. I've ordered 3-4 cases off of amazon and have not had any trouble with quality or consistency between batches. So I'm honestly not sure if they are just unlucky out of the thousands or if there is a particular seller that's holding onto bad stock. While the individual containers aren't huge, they aren't meant to be guzzled like a gatorade bottle. It's more of a \"sipping\" drink, or a way to quickly hydrate and get your electrolytes quickly.",

I bought a twelve pack in the last year or so. I'm like \"gross! what happened?\" They have added vitamin C to this product as the label states. That gives it a funny aftertaste, kind of tangy. It doesn't state in what form the vitamin C is in, or what type of product the vitamin C is from (citric acid? natural fruit source?). It could be some other reason...maybe they changed their coconut supplier, or have an additive that is not on the label. Keep in mind not all additives have to be on the label. It is definitely no longer the same product as in 2009. Did they actually think no one would notice? To fix this problem, I just went to using fresh young coconuts from Costco (the white ones). They come in box of 9 for about $16. You can easily open them with a chefs knife in about 40 seconds, and dump out the water into a bowel. There is an instruction video on the internet for your viewing pleasure. Keep as much plastic on as you can though, they dip the coconuts in a preservative before shipping. You get about 13.5 oz per coconut, so that would be $1.77. This item is about $1.71 per 11.1 oz. So the cost is very comparable, especially because you can use the pulp if you want. I have also seen them at Uwajimaya for $2.50 a piece. I don't find the pulp as useful as the brown dried coconuts however. Fresh pulp is more like a gel. So I say, why not just use fresh?",

If you're adding sugar to it then it's no longer 100% pure coconut water. Those of us who choose a natural product understand that the taste and consistency of products will vary, as is noted on the label: \"taste and color may vary\". They've also added vitamin C, which doesn't bother me as much, but once again it's that issue of I'm buying a 100% coconut water product and I don't want you messing with it. Take ZICO for example. Their product contains less sugar and no vitamin C based on their label. The ingredient list is 100% natural coconut water. I can accept pasteurizing a product, but don't add stuff to it and then call it 100% pure coconut water. Even if it's a tiny amount added to help with product consistency it's still no longer a pure product. However, they know that if they were honest and the front of the container said \"coconut water with added sugar\" they would lose a portion of their consumer base. Why is honesty so hard to get these days from companies that sell products in this niche market?",

I had been doing a lot of Bikram Yoga and read that coconut water was the best thing to hydrate with, so I said well I will just drink all of these until I run out, and just deal with the taste of it by drinking as fast as possible. Needless to say the first few packages were hard to swallow, literally, but after I had drank them for about a week I started to like the more and more, to the point where I could enjoy the drink. Now I order them on a regular basis, I don't know if it just takes a while to get used to them or not, but I would highly recommend this item.

I recently moved to a more rural area and found that the price on Amazon was much better than what I could get at my nearby grocery store. I normally purchase the 11.1 oz boxes but decided that the best price was to be had on the Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 17-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) . Unfortunately, my first case arrived a week or so ago and I was absolutely appalled! The coco water was virtually undrinkable. It was very sour, slightly discolored, and nothing like the drink to which I'd become accustomed. I immediately contacted Amazon, and they agreed to ship me another box at no charge. The second case was similarly poor in quality. I told Amazon that I'd like a refund so that I could order a different size. The case of Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12) just arrived, and it has been only marginally better in taste, if at all. I don't know if Amazon is storing the coconut water improperly, if Vita Coco has produced a bad batch (they all have exp dates in October of 2012), or if they've somehow altered their source or coco water/Vit C mixture (all boxes say they are produced in the Philippines). I plan to contact Vita Coco directly to find out the problem, and will also be requesting a third refund from Amazon. These boxes taste so bad that I plan to pour them all down the sink in order to recycle the tetrapaks. Very disappointed.",

In the Philippines, which even has a ministry for coconuts, they are availabe on every market and street corner, totally fresh.

            "review_text": "I purchased a case of three different brands of coconut water from Amazon to compare; UFC, C2O and Vita Coco. While at Whole Foods I talked to the man who stocked the coconut water section and I learned two things. First, he told me when I asked which coconut water tasted best that it depended on the lot. He explained that since coconuts were plants, each harvest was different and that the SAME brand varied in taste depending on the lot. I guess it is kind of like wine. Second, he said that differnt coconut waters contain different levels of sugar and that I should note the sugar content on the package. With that additional information in mind, I considered that various lots may be different in taste but the sugar content on the label should remain fairly consistent. Among the three coconut waters C2O tasted the sweetest but I liked the flavor of UFC best. That's purely a personal opinion. My guess is that most would like C2O best due to it's sweeter taste. C2O was sweetest, UFC next and Vita Coco least sweet. I then compared the amount of sugar listed on the label. Although there should be no added sugar, coconut water contains natural sugar. I am listing the sugar per ounce since the sugar is listed on the label as per serving but serving size varies from 8 ounces to 11.1 ounces therefore a grams per ounce measurement gives you an apples to apples comparison. C2O 1.5g/oz, VitaCoco 1.35g/oz and UFC 1g/oz. UFC actually tastes sweeter to me than VitaCoco (or rather more flavorful) but has nearly a third less sugar and much less sugar than C2O. For me the choice is clear, UFC. It has the least amount of sugar and it tastes best since I don't prefer overly sweet drinks but I do like the flavor. I bought the UFC in 1L wax paper containers, C2O in 17.5 oz (530ml) cans and VitaCoco in 11.1 oz. wax paper containers. All of the coconut waters tasted very good and I don't think that you will be disappointed in either of them. UPDATE Oct 2015: C20 has actually reduced the sugar content in the latest 1L carton that I purchased. It is now 7g/serving which is 0.875g/oz. I now buy C2O since it has the least amount of sugar and tastes very good. C2O is also rather widely available in stores.",

VitaCoco uses 100% pure coconut water and it is not from concentrate. I purchased a box of this due to health related purposes. Coconut water, for those who do not know, is very close to human blood. In the past, they actually used to use coconut water as an IV! That's how close coconut water is in terms of blood-like properties. This of course is a good thing. Also, coconut oil (as opposed to coconut water) is very good for your since it does not turn toxic when you cook it like other oils. In addition to these things, coconut has antibiotic and antimicrobial properties, and is very good for the skin. With this drink, I can one day have the skin necessary to ask Jessica Alba on a date. Coconut water is one of the best things for moisturizing your body from the inside out. Here is a summary of this product: PROS: -One of the best internal moisturizers for your body -Is not diluted; it is not from concentrate -Good antimicrobial properties -Has blood-like properties CONS: -Initial taste may not suit you (it may take time to adjust) -Amazon does not sell it for free",

I can't have that amount of sugar on a regular basis. For hydrating nothing beats water. I workout every day and run as well as chop wood. My diet is varied and provides more than enough of these nutrients. Blood test was excellent. Nutritional content; I am sure it has some of the qualities that it boasts, but I am not willing to make the sugar compromise for the magnesium/potassium benefit. I will just take a supplement. It is cheaper. Plus I eat way to much cocoa and that has the highest amount of magnesium from a natural product. For potassium; plantains are good. They are just like bananas.

Amazon was nice enough to replace it. BUT ... the 3rd batch was worse. It wasn't yellowish, but it was a bit darker in color. And it did not taste like coconut water at all. I was hoping the 3rd batch would be better - as it had a best before date of April 2010. The second batch was January 2010. But I guess that doesn't really make a difference, as you may get unlucky (twice?!) and get a bad batch. I am not contacting Amazon for another replacement. Dissapointing.

Supposedly this is one of the best drinks to replenish electrolytes - a natural Gatorade, as it were - with minimal calories and natural ingredients (just coconut water) - no sugar added or anything else for that matter. In terms of taste, I was less than enthused. Sure, this tastes fine, but the thick texture really got to me. It tasted of coconut for sure, but it was very sweet (although not artificially). It was refreshing, but this variety really wasn't floating my boat so to speak. Due to the excellent nutrition facts, I would definitely try the other flavored varieties, such as Acai & Pom, Pineapple, Peach & Mango, Tangerine and Passion Fruit.

Vita Coco has the most natural flavor, with no off tastes, and a slightly sweet, nutty flavor. 2 (tie). Zico tastes slightly citrusuy and slighty \"green\" (like a green banana). 2 (tie). ONE ends on a slightly bitter note. 4. Naked has an off taste that I do not care for at all. I threw out all of the \"Naked\" boxes after my taste test. Zico and ONE are drinkable, but both have flavors beyond the pure clean coconutty taste of Vita Coco. I won't through the Zico or ONE out, but I'll drink all the Vita Coco first.",

The Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12) is an affordable way to get my coconut water fix, thanks to the additional discount of the Subscribe & Save program. It comes out to about half the price when buying it individually in stores (at least the ones I checked). Taste wise, I don't really have a preference between this and the Zico coconut water. This size is a better for me because once I open a bottle, I usually finish it off. So this size serves as portion control. One tetra pak is 60 calories. But my pet peeve still remains, if it has calories and other ingredients, can we please call it something other than water? While this is coming out of a coconut so it's not as bad, I find it rather annoying that different companies make sugary drinks or drinks with sugar-substitutes and call them water. Okay, rant is over! Overall, I like this. I usually drink it over a few ice cubes. I try to limit it to one per day, since 60 calories are 60 calories. My next experiment is to make ice cubes out of it, but I need a bigger ice cube tray! PS: the 12pk arrives in a sturdy colorful cardboard box that can be reused/repurposed.",

Also bear in mind, on a large manufacturing scale, sugar is a bunch cheaper than coconut water so the company is substituting a cheap filler ingredient for 1% of their product. I also can't help but notice vita coco isn't 1% cheaper than the competition.",

I tried coconut water or juice in a can and it made me threw up.So I avoided it.Last 2 weeks ago I saw this new product in the grocery store. Its the Naked coconut water,It actually tasted not bad but expensive.I tried another brand,O.N.E. this one even tastes better.And now I tried this VitaCoCo.

I currently order two cases for the month which is definitely not enough, because my husband drinks them like they are kool-aid, but eventually as I get my grocery bill down to something manageable I will add more to the list. At the middle of the month he begins looking for his order, which means that I am going to have to do a shipment twice a month to keep him happy, but I can't complain as long as he is using it and it healthy for you, no need to complain.

I think it's their duty to inform me whenever the price changes before delivering the next product as I might not think it's worth the increased price! It is a very fluctuating price, so I will keep an eye from now on. Edit 6/6/2011 : After having this subscribed for a few months now, Yes, I do see consistency issues in the taste as well (as others were) and I have noticed that this month also the price is $5 more ($19.55) than what I had subscribed it for. So I'm skipping this month. I know next month it'll come back to around $14.

Maybe amazon is carrying a different version, but what I got doesn't taste the same as what I had in the store. There is a weird grape-like taste, like canned grape juice. I'm pretty sure the version I had from the grocery had Vitamin C listed as an ingredient (which I didn't mind). This package lists no ingredients besides coconut water, which I don't think is true advertising. It's not listed as an ingredient, but the package says it contains 230% of the Daily Value of Vitamin C. Coconuts are not a natural source of vitamin C, so I find it suspicious that it has that much and Vitamin C/Ascorbic Acid is not listed as an ingredient. I would not order this again.",

When I opened the case, I discovered that it contains \"less than 1% added fruit sugar\". Wasn't sure what that meant, so I looked it up. Turns out, fruit sugar is another name for FRUCTOSE. The total grams of sugar listed is 15 for the 11 oz container. It's not clear how much of this is from the fructose. I went to the Vita Coco website and they say they add the \"fruit sugar\" to standardize the sweetness. They say it is not from corn, but from fruits. I doubt the body much cares where the fructose comes from. Fructose. like sugar, is not good for your health. Check out \"Sugar, the bitter truth\" on youtube by Dr Lustig.

So when I came across Vita Coco Coconut Water, Pure, 11.1 Ounce here on Amazon and it was available to add to my subscriptions I has on it. This is one of my favorite brands of coconut water and I really like that the packaging is recyclable and designed to take up less space (able to crush it) in the bin. The fact that each container is resealable is also a plus just in case I do not use the entire amount in what ever I am doing. I really like the fact that it is available for subscription. So I no longer have to remember when I go to the store and then have to lug it back on a bus! STAR RATINGS: Each product is carefully reviewed in an unbiased manner. Star ratings are earned, never given. 5 Star: I really love this product, it is an exceptional, impressive product. It is very well made (designed, formulated, composed, etc) and lives up to the product details and description. It exceeds normal consumer expectations. 4 Star: I like this product. It meets the product description, details, and normal customer expectations. It does what it is supposed to do. 3 Star: This is not a negative rating. It is a neutral rating. I could take it or leave it. It met the product description and details for the most part but isn't something I am ever likely to order again. 2 Star: I don't like this product. It has mistakes in the product details or description and does not live up to what it advertises or normal customer expectations. 1 Star: I really do not like this product. There may be something wrong in the product details or description, it does not live up to what it is advertised as. I would tell my friends, acquaintances, and strangers that they shouldn't use their hard earned money on this product. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Please consider following me here on Amazon for other reviews. Thanks and have a blessed day.",

Since I have grown up drinking coconut water fresh out of the shell, I can tell subtle differences in the taste. From the brands I have tried so far, Vita Coco comes closest to the fresh coconut water from the shell. The taste is similar to the water from \"raw\" coconuts which do not have any tender coconut flesh formed in them. Personally I prefer the water from a little \"ripe\" coconuts. As the flesh forms in the coconut the quantity of water reduces but it tastes sweeter. I like the fact that there are no added ingredients in this coconut water and unlike \"Zico\" this is not made from concentrate but 100% real fresh coconut water. BTW, Zico is terrible. Don't bother trying it. See my review of \"Zico\" for details. I am into outdoor sports and drink coconut water after exhaustive workouts. It provides both hydration and electrolytes. I liked Vita Coco so much that I have subscribed to it from Amazon. I am giving 4 Stars simply because it does not have my \"preferred taste\", but there is nothing negative about this product. I think they should include a straw. It does not bother me but some people may prefer a straw.",

I was filling an Amazon Pantry box when I saw this with a coupon and figured this was a good time to try. Maybe it is just the brand, or maybe they all taste alike, I wouldn't know to say. All I can say is that I could only manage a few sips of this milky/watery beverage. It was slightly sweet, which I normally like, it did have authentic coconut flavor, but, I don't know, it just didn't taste Good. At least not to me. I was very disappointed. And more so to leave a less than stellar review, as that always makes me feel bad. But I am here to help others as they have helped me, so I have to do what needs to be done.

First order of 11 oz Vita Coco was great. I was shocked. Printed on lower right side of carton \"Produced in Brazil\" Second order, this order of 2 cases, first taste...horrendous. Almost undrinkable. If it were undrinkable I would have scored just 1 star. In any case, \"I\" will not be drinking it. This second order, lower right side states \"Produced in Philippines\" Hmm. Having been to the Philippines, I am not surprised! Conclusion: Look for \"Produced in Brazil\" on carton. \"Born in Brazil\" is worthless and meaningless. Ignore. I'll be asking for \"Produced in Brazil\" coconut water only. May have to settle for local shopping, since there is no way I reckon to confirm source with Amazon orders. On the other hand, may have just been a fluke, but i doubt it. Even freshly cut-and-served coconuts sold on Philippine streets were often so-so tasting. Probably the result of baking in the hot sun, as these fruit carts were not shaded. Poor people just trying to feed their families, can hardly blame 'em. One more example of how competition detracts from quality of life here in this 21st century. I guess I'll be hopping between natural food stores checking labels, attempting to dodge unhealthy poor quality foods, that I thought we were paying the government to protect us from. hmm.

It says something like less than 1% or whatever but still it is there. For people looking to buy these, lookout for amazon subscribe and save offers on the 12 case of the Vita coco coconut water. This product is made in Philippines. It comes in a tetra pack juice box like packing but with a proper opening above with a cap of its own so you can store away partially consumed coconut water. Overall great tasting coconut water. If you are reluctant to buy a 12 case, I suggest get a single pack from a big box store and try it. Should be $2 or so for a bigger packaging (16 Oz ?)",

It tastes more like a processed coconut flavored drink. I was curious why it has such a high rating and I can only assume but a lot of the 5 star reviews look like they could be fake. Too many single word or generic sounding reviews. Very strange. Bottom line for me is there's no way this is pure coconut water and it just does not taste good. If this is the only coconut water you've tried I highly recommend trying a few other brands or getting an actual coconut so you can experience the true flavor. The real stuff has a milky taste to it.

No additivies(The Zico adds Electrolytes) or preservatives and taste as natural as it can get. As per some reviews saying the taste is not consistent, please note it is not an artificially manufactured product or machine processed ,so the taste may vary slightly .But I ordered it about three times so far and felt good all the three times.

It's barely sweet, in fact a sour taste stands out more than anything. If one knows what coconut taste like then one can find the coconut flavor some where in this juice, but it doesn't stand out. The juice is pretty clear with a SLIIIIIIGHT yellow color tint so there was no oddities with the coloration. I really did try to like this product, I've only 3 units left and still I'm just not seeing it. Perhaps a bad batch???... a really bad batch??? If this was someone's first experience with coconut juice, they would probably not be a big fan of it. I will refrain from buying this product, and I advise the same to others.",

It's not as sweet as other brands. Doubtlessly, It doesn't equal fresh coconut water, but it is one of the best you can get from a tetra pack bottle. I take it almost once a day and can be also used to make smoothies. I would recommend this for anyone that loves coconut water, you will not be disappointed.",

I suggest trying one before you purchase in quantity. Update: after reading the reviews of this product be in rancid, I agree. I think that that is why it had such a horrible taste.

I email Vita Coco asking about this and got a marketing BS response about how they need to sweeten so it's consistent. I guess if you buy a whole coconut in the store Vita Coco has injected it with sugar to correct nature's mistake. This is a blatant attempt to fool people with a sweeter tasting product instead of offering an unaltered natural product.",

Vita, however, has a weird acidic-like after taste that I just cant get used to. IT kind of reminds me of vomit tbh. Idk. Maybe I got a bad batch or something. I ordered this on 3-27-2013 and the exp date is july 2013, whereas, zico was ordered on the same day and the exp date is sept 2015. But this probably isn't the reason why vita has that weird after taste. It seems other people have had the same experience as well. Some people actually prefer vita over zico so I think it all just really comes down to the individual. I recommend buying each brand and testing it out for yourselves.

I also wonder how they can call it 100% pure if it has added Vitamin C - which they would have to do in order to get a 230% daily value - that's about 138mg of vita c, and the normal amount (I found while net surfing) is about 5 mg per 8oz serving, which should make this no more than 10 mg of vita c for 11.2 oz.

I just thought this would be a good, quick reminder of the real thing to drink on the go and not a can of soda. They picture this with a straw, it comes with no straws.

They had case upon case of vita coco in their car. They left some with me and I grew to love it. I have always been a fan of coconut anway..even adding the oil to drinks and drinking it dissolved in warm water etc. I believe in the health benefits in moderation. So, I began ordering here monthly and have enjoyed carton after carton until I recently opened my new box and drank a carton. First pouring it into the cup it was urine yellow..not kidding! I guess almost like apple juice. I was really skeeved but decided to drink it...and it was disgusting. Didn't smell very bad, just off, but was nothing like the white cloudy vita coco with a yummy almost milk like taste I have grown accustomed to. I decided to open another the next day and same story..I felt like gagging it was so strong and gross tasting...not even close to the same drink and certainly not refreshing by any stretch of the imagination. I decided to look in the recycling at the old cartons left in there that I had drank previously, and I made the discovery that my old vita coco's were made in Brazil while this new box, all the cartons said product of Mexico...that must be it, maybe?? I called Amazon and let them know and they sent me a replacement box. This new box also had cartons made in Mexico. I refrigerated two to try. The next day I opened one and sure enough..yellow and disgusting. Not as bad as the first box but same taste overall. I will pour them all down the drain. What a complete waste. Needless to say I will not order vita coco ever again unless maybe I had a guarantee the coconuts were from Brazil. I am saddened but now I am trying a new brand, Naked..we'll see! Amazon was great about the whole thing. I hope they can clarify this disparity with vita coco. It's a shame vita coco does not have better quality control. I know their packaging states there is variance between the products but this was not an acceptable variance..this was just plain disgusting and no one in their right mind would drink them!",

The type with pineapple added is a bit more enjoyable than the \"straight\" product, but not enough so that I'll order more at the price. If you have experience with coconut water and like it, you may like this very well, but I predict most will think it is \"okay\" and nothing more.",

Not a single friend with whom I shared a sample could identify the taste as coconut, and even when told that was what it was supposed to be, they argued that I was misleading them.

I originally picked up some cases of ZICO for my wife a few months ago when Amazon was running a promotion. She liked it and thought it was pretty good. I took one sip and that was all I could stand, and vowed never to try it again! My wife just recently used up all the ZICO so I came to Amazon to buy some more for her. While here, I happened to stumble across the Vita Coco brand and decided to read the customer reviews. I was very happy with what I had read, so I decided to take a chance and purchase a case. It arrived yesterday and after chilling it in the fridge for a while, I gave one to my wife to try. She let out a big MMMMM after the first sip! I was curious, so I deicided to grab my own carton and have a taste. One sip turned into two, and then three, and four, and more! I have to say, Vita Coco is a really great tasting coconut water, and I am now hooked! This may sound silly, but for me the package graphics actually make the beverage more enjoyable! I originally bought this for my wife, but now I'm back here on Amazon and ready to purchase some more before I end up drinking it all myself! Let me just finish by saying that for someone who had never drank coconut water in his life, and could not tolerate a second sip of ZICO, you can believe that Vita Coco is a great tasting, quality brand that I'm sure you will just love! I only wish it was a little cheaper on the wallet, but it's still worth it in my book. Guess that will make me savor it even more, like a fine wine. I just finished one carton about 10 minutes ago, and now after writing this review, I'm ready to grab another one! For the record, my intent is not to bash ZICO at all. My wife still likes the taste of it and would still buy it. You may have tried it and like it as well, and that's good! I'm just giving my opinion as someone who has never drank coconut water at all, and found Vita Coco to be the most enjoyable to me. If you're not sure, then give them both a try and see what you think. But if you are new to coconut water, I think you would enjoy the Vita Coco brand and should probably give that a try first.",

I enjoy coconut flavored foods and drinks but I have never eaten or drank the juice from a real coconut. I opened a carton of this stuff and immediately recoiled in disgust at the mere smell coming from it. Certain that the liquid must have spoiled I checked the expiration date and tried opening a second carton but to the same effect. Deciding that must be how it normally smells I gave it an experimental sip........and immediately gagged. I couldn't even take a full swig much less actually swallow it. What does this tastes like you ask? Hmmm, imagine you get a Sprite with your combo meal at a fast food place, drink half of it, and then leave it in your hot garage for two weeks until fuzzy mold starts growing in it. It would taste a lot like this Vita Coco Coconut Water. This is without a doubt the most awful tasting liquid I have ever come across in my life. It's worse than all the various nasty medicines my mother forced me to take when I was a child. It's worse than the time I accidentally drank from a jug that my dad had put frog legs in. If I were to describe what this stuff is to a child I would call it \"fruit urine\". The fact that this isn't some crazy snake oil miracle cure but an actual beverage is shocking to me. If you are looking for something to drink try literally ANYTHING besides this stuff.",

Here is the problem, the last (2) cases of VitaCoco that I received from Amazon were VERY off tasting. I don't know how to describe it exactly except to say it was a bit sour and not quite fresh. I could not drink it and I know that it is not supposed to taste like this. If I had to imagine the problem I might guess the product was allowed to experience large scale temperature changes, but who knows? I won't buy this product from Amazon anymore because I don't have time to deal with sending it back and ordering again. I have been Buying Amy&Brians at the Organic Grocery down the street.

I can't evaluate the claims of benefits, though I would agree it is healthier than the same amount of soda. The plastic bottle makes it convenient to carry around and reseal if you don't finish it all at once. To save a bit of money and cut down on packaging, get the larger 33 oz Tetra Pak and pour it into your own water bottle. As a bonus, if you use an insulated bottle, it will stay cold for much longer. 5 stars for taste.

The liquid did NOT taste like coconut at all--my only prior exposure to coconut was the shredded kind used in cakes and macaroons. The nutrition information on the 2-serving bottle says that a serving contains 460mg potassium, 70mg sodium, and 11mg carbohydrates (including 10mg sugars). I guess that consuming the product after a workout is a good way of replacing electrolytes, but a serving also delivers 45 calories.

The companies website will try to sell you the story of why they do this, talking about the weight of coconuts/cost to import, blah blah blah. If you care to know more and actually benefit from your money spent on what you thought was a healthy product, then be a smart consumer and do the research. A great site (which I have zero affiliation with whatsoever, and simply found when doing my own research) can be found by searching on foodbabe and coconut water. The big brands are quite eye opening, but shouldn't be a surprise to you. To your good health and being a more knowledgeable, smart consumer.",

I am so happy I had the opportunity to find another brand to love that is reasonably priced. My Vita Coco arrived fast and fresh. I saw some reviewers mention theirs had an off-color, but mine was a white-ish color. It's about the same sweetness level as the other brands I enjoy. It looks right, smells right and tastes great!

I get nutrients delivered in my body more consistently. What I do is mix about 1/4 regular filtered water in with it. I started adding a bit of water to it just to be sure it would still quench my thirst and dilute the flavor just a bit. When I first did it, it was 50/50, eventually it's where the majority of my water bottle is coconut water. I attach two water bottles on my bike when I ride, so my second bottle is just water only. I have a friend who thinks the taste is awful, but she drinks the chocolate flavor and loves it. So, if it's the taste - then try others, because this stuff is really good for you. It's so much better than those sports drinks like Gatorade; they have so much sugar that it's counterproductive. Due to all the sugar in sports drinks, they really don't quench my thirst anyway. They actually make me more thirsty because it leaves a bad taste in my mouth or makes it feel like my tongue is coated with sugar. I then have to reach for water and wash that taste away. But with coconut water, there is no aftertaste bothering my taste buds. So two awesome things it does for me is that it quenches thirst and helps improve performance.",

In contrast, the Zico ingredients section lists only \"pure coconut water.\" Further evidence that sugar is an additive in Vita comes from the caloric counts--Vita has a higher calorie per ml value. Finally (and perhaps what matter most), Zico just plain tastes better--there is an authentic \"flavor\" to it. There are no two ways about it.

            "review_text": "When I was in the Philippines I visited Bataan and Corregidor. These were sites of some of the most intense fighting in the Pacific during WWII. The tour guide's grandmother was an American nurse in the war who had been captured. The tour guide told us captured American soldiers were usually not given medical supplies or food. Often these soldiers became dehydrated in the intense jungle heat. Her grandmother and other nurses turned to coconut water in place of IV fluid. Coconut water and blood have the same five electrolytes. Coconut water helped sustain dehydrated soldiers during their internment, hence \"fluid of life.\" Later on in the tour, the guide cracked open a young coconut. I had the opportunity to drink the coconut water and I really enjoyed it. Coming back to the States I found three brands of coconut water, Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12) , ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12) and O.N.E. Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12) . I purchased all three. I tried O.N.E first, which is the cheapest. It tasted nothing like coconut water I'd had in the Philippines. It tastes too sweet. If you like a sweeter drink you might want to try O.N.E. For an authentic taste, I'd avoid it. I like both Vita Coco and Zico. Their prices fluctuate on Amazon, but are pretty similar. Zico is a little cheaper as of this writing. Zico's flavor is light, probably the lightest of the three, and most similar to water. I think Vita Coco has more complex flavor than Zico, which is why I prefer Vita Coco. Nutritionally they are all very similar. Only substantial difference is Vita Coco has higher levels of manganese. In my opinion Vita Coco is best, followed by Zico and O.N.E. If I were you I'd think about trying a single of Vita Coco and Zico. Whatever your choice, you can't go wrong. Typical sports drinks have lots of calories and only share two of the electrolytes blood has. Coconut water is a 60 calorie drink chock-full of electrolytes. It is the perfect refresher for a workout, lazy afternoon or night out on the town.",

Quality from shipment to shipment is excellent. I have no complaints about these, and have been most impressed.

I have \"subscribed\" from Amazon and get at least 12 box (12x12 bottles). I love to bring couple of them to the gym and they did hydrate me. Given this fact, how should I write a two star review? Because they change it !! I just got my recent order a week ago and it taste wrong. It's more like a vitamin C water with a coconut flavor. All of my family member feel the difference and we notice that the flavor is nasty because it taste like a sour water now. It's not \"fresh\". I take a look of the ingredient and I know why. They double (or precisely, 230%) the vitamin C. Vitamin is a type of \"preservative\" that people add to drink to avoid being rotten quickly. Having too much vitamin C is BAD BAD BAD to your body. I usually had 3-4 bottle and it means that I have 300-400% vitamin C and I think it's okay. But now I would consume about 1000% recommend vitamin C if I drink 4 bottles a day. I will never buy this product again. They did a shady business. Clamming it's pure but keep adding preservative. Yes, I know adding preservative prolong the \"sell-before date\". From the perspective of business, they can \"double\" the preservative period, meaning making more money. (don't have to worry keeping lots of items in stock). But the water now taste \"nasty\" and it's even not close to a \"pure\" coconut water. I'm very unhappy because the product description contains no ingredient information and they don't even mentioned that they change the ingredient!

To me, it just taste like sugar water, or non-fresh coconut water that has been left out too long and thus fermented. It was this tart aftertaste with a faint hint of coconut flavor.

I would have thought 'pineapples' or the tropical weather but, heck, if it made him nostalgic for paradise then who was I to disagree? In the 1960's it was hard to find stores that carried them fresh. So he ordered them via the mail. He owned several health food stores so he bought only the best. I hated the stuff as a kid but when I got older my tastes changed and I started to eat the flesh/meat and drink the juice. Over the years I've bought them and allowed them to rot in the back of the fridge when I forgot about them. Waste of money... So, lately I've been buying the pure-pak versions because they last longer and require no special tools or hard work to extract the delicious water. Unless I'm making coconut milk I'll avoid them in the produce section. Sometimes I get bad coconuts and they'll taste like vinegar or be black inside. This happens way too often. Last weekend I bought two to make coconut milk and one of them tasted like vinegar. $2.50 tossed in the garbage. The other one was fine but not as fresh tasting as I'd liked. I use coconut water in my smooties, homemade icecream in my Vitamix blender, in frozen confections, and in a variety of other drinks from coffee, almond milk and chocolate milk. VitaCoco is one of the best tasting 100% pure coconut waters that I've tried over the last few decades. I've bought the water frozen, in cans and in the purepak containers. I also like O.N.E. coconut water but it's a little too expensive and tastes about the same as Vita Coco. The best is frozen but it's expensive and hard to find. Vita Coco is easy to find at Big Lots for about $1.50 for 33 oz. They have a variety of flavors but I prefer the lemonade and plain for my smoothies. Another reviewer didn't like the taste but I think the taste varies from time to time anyway and maybe the reviewer bought it when it was near or past the 'best by' date as I've noticed a difference in taste with I drank one that was past its date. It was still drinkable but not as fresh tasting. I used it in a smoothie and I couldn't tell the difference anyway. I recommend this brand if you can find it at a reasonable price.",

Your own palette is the best for you, which means everyone's review is subjective, but hopefully it gives you a good idea. The coconut water is a $1 Billion industry, so all things considered, there is a lot of money and hype here. Now coconut water has different tastes depending on how young or old the coconut is. When very young, it is bitter. When very old (with firm thick flesh inside), it feels like coconut oil is mixed in. When dry, the flesh is what they use to make coconut oil. It is best to see few things when comparing reviews: - Brand name of the product (Vita Coco vs Zico vs ... ) - Origin of the product (Note: Size of the product as well - this one keeps changing based on if it is 1 liter vs 11.1 oz etc) Always make a note of the origin, that way you know what you like. - Packaging of the product (Tetra pak, Can, ...) - 100% natural or with flavors/additives ... This is Nov 2015 and I will write my review based on current taste. I will need to update it when this changes. 1. Vita Coco: The 11.1oz tetra pak is made in Brazil, and this is the one I really love. It tastes close to having coconut water fresh from the coconut. A bit sweeter in taste when compared to the rest, and good original flavor. 4 stars 2. Zico Original Coconut Water: I took the 1 liter packs. They are from Thailand, and I don't particularly like this. Very different from Vita Coco, and I think a lot of young coconuts (not mature) have also been used. I have tried many batches all this year and they all taste about the same. When the coconut is not mature, there is a bitter taste in it (can't quite put in words) - now that is still healthy, but not as good in the mouth! 3 stars. 3. O.N.E. coconut water: It used to taste very good a while back, but currently tastes just about ok, . There is a slight coconut oil taste to this, maybe some coconuts used for the water are probably very matured. Recently, they have also started adding flavor. WHAT?? Yes, you read that right. it is no longer pure coconut water. I don't even know why they want to do that. 2.5 stars 4. Naked coconut water: Country of Origin was Philippines. Very watered down, and doesn't taste like pure coconut water. It has an aftertaste. Something tells me this is not 100 % coconut water, I didn't like this and trashed it before I could check if they have also added flavor to it. 2 stars. So my advice: try 1 of any brand . Note down the country of origin, etc. Unless something else changes with their formula, stick to what you liked and you will be happy. Some batches might have issues, but should hopefully be delightful to drink! P.S.: I still need to taste Nirvana, C2O and Harmless Harvest that a few have noted in the reviews for coconut water.",

I took them home and am trying to use them myself since there is no way my brother with his limited appetite is able to get down even a sip of this stuff. I really don't get it, it is supposed to be the real thing, why doesn't it taste like real coconut? Is it sitting on a shelf and souring? Are they using older coconuts?

I tried them all at the same time and overall my favorite is vita coco. Its the one with the light smell and taste and actually reminded me of fresh coconut from when i was in the PH. Surprisingly i liked Vita Coco from Brazil best which disappointed me since i thought the ones from the PH would taste best for me. One and Naked have this distinct smell similar to when you open a can of coconut milk. The taste is similar to smell though One is a lot stronger than Naked's. Between One and Naked, i'd prefer Naked but between all three, i'd prefer Vita Coco. The clarity of the three sources are pretty much the same for me and closer to cloudy white as expected.

These bottles are plastic as opposed to the cartons that I often have seen coconut water in. Mine was sourced in Thailand. The bottles contain only coconut water and less than 1% sugar and Vitamin C. The color is cloudy clear, the way it should be. The taste is mild. It isn't very coconutty tasting but smooth and just slightly sweet. I admit, coconut water is not my favorite drink. I prefer iced tea and other drinks but it can be a refreshing change. There is 13% of the RDA of potassium and 4% of magnesium along with 4% of calcium and 3% of sodium so this drink is pretty good for summer days or after workouts when you sweat and need to replenish some electrolytes. These come naturally from the coconuts and are not added. If you like coconut water, this brand is a good one. I have had it before and the bottles I received taste the same as the ones I bought in the store last summer. I am going with 4 stars. I don't LOVE the taste but it's refreshing and healthy. I also feel that the water is fresh and free from extraneous stuff my body doesn't need. One 16.9 ounce bottle is two servings but I just drank the whole thing. At just 45 calories per serving, I don't feel guilty about that! Next time, I am going to try the pineapple infused coconut water. I think that would add just the right punch of flavor that I feel is missing from plain coconut water.",

I just don't very much like coconut water, and interestingly neither does anyone else in my house including my wife and kids. The flavor is mildly sweet with a slightly syrupy, slightly \"slippery\" mouth feel. My wife very much dislikes the mouth feel while I'm just not a fan of the flavor. Anyway, for those that DO like the flavor of coconut water. The color was good, a slightly cloudy light color which apparently represents good quality. Additionally, the box and bottles inside arrived in good condition. So if you're a fan of coconut water, this seems like a good choice.

Coconut water is great, if you are in the market for a case of it you already know this. But which of these three is the best? I went around town and found 5 boxes of each of the three brands (15 total) each, with no two boxes of a the same brand coming from the same supplier. The goal was to get a wide range of product batches. This I am happy to report was pointless. All three brands produce an internally consistent product. I then ordered a 12 pack of all three brands from Amazon. The only significant difference in packaging is that O.N.E. glues a little telescoping straw to each individual box, the other two brands do not. If you are a straw person this is a feature if not this is just more trash, you decide. The amount per container varies slightly by brand but given the price fluctuation on Amazon I don't consider the 0.1 Oz differences an important factor. All three are made in Brazil, O.N.E. mentions that it is pasteurized the other two do not (nevertheless, I suspect all three are). On pure taste, at refrigerator temperature, I found Zico to be the best (say 5/5), but only nominally better than O.N.E. (4.5/5), Vita was a distant third (3/5). Both Zico and O.N.E. taste almost exactly like drinking right from a fresh green coconut. Vita, on the other hand, has a grape aftertaste which I did not like. At room temperature the order remained the same; however, the differences in taste became more obvious: Zico (5/5), O.N.E. (4/5), Vita (2/5). Obviously all of this is subjective. I observed the price of three on Amazon over the course of a month. Zico (~$24) was consistently more expensive than the other two (~$18-21) which traded places as the least expensive. Considering the price and quality, O.N.E. is my choice and the brand to which I now subscribe. I consider Zico an excellent, but over priced, product and Vita an inferior product. If, however, I preferred my coconut water at room temperature I would give strong consideration to paying the extra money for Zico. If I used my coconut water as a mixer I would buy which ever one is cheapest at the time. All three products are better than nothing (the previous option) and I am happy to see them on the market.",

Assuming you don't get a bad batch, ONE is the sweetest tasting of the three followed by Zico then Vita Coco. Naked has the lightest taste and some like the subtle flavor. Vita Coco adds Vitamin C to preserve the coconut water thus it can taste a bit more tart. If they put too much of it, it tastes kinda sour like this recent batch that I bought from them. Coconut water is great but the biggest issue is quality of the coconut that is harvested at the time. All four can taste bad if you get a bad batch so I wish these manufacturers would do a better job of making them taste similar across different batches. I know this can be difficult but if they do it, this would eliminate a lot of bad reviews due to poor quality control. Even though I got a bad batch, I will still continue to drink coconut water and will use any of these four brands but the quantity will depend on price and what other reviewers here write on the batch they get.",

It's definitely NOT \"like sticking a straw in a coconut\" like they have claimed. I lived in Indonesia for over 10 years and I have stuck a straw in a coconut, and I can tell you it does not taste like this. There's some sort of (funky/sourness) smell to this that hit me right before I start drinking it and that totally ruined it for me. I don't know if that's due to the Vit C that they added, or perhaps the tetra packaging... all I know is It's not one of my favorites.",

I recently had a bad virus and this was a wonderful soothing benefit for my sore throat. There are other benefits as well. There's a great book available about coconut water well worth buying. Look it up, Amazon probably has it available.. ADDED NOTE: I recently had surgery. As I was coming out of the \"happy place\" I heard the surgeon yelling for the blood count results. \"This guy lost a lot of blood, I think we might need to give him a transfusion\". The nurse presented him with my test and he said, \"I'll be darned. It's normal. It shouldn't be but it is.\" The nurse, who is from Hawaii, told the doctor they drink this stuff all the time and it's considered a life source. She told him about the plasma bit. The smartass Urologist just looked at her and said something about stupid superstitious primitive beliefs. She just rolled her eyes and walked away. What else could she do, this guy is THE surgeon and he thinks he knows everything. Jerk thinks if you can't cure it with a knife or expensive pills and countless tests, it can't be any good. If you've done any research on coconut water, you know how close it is to blood plasma and that they used it during WWII when they didn't have real plasma. The fact that I drink this wonderful juice may not be the only reason my blood work was normal, but you'd have trouble convincing me that it wasn't a major contributor to keeping my blood chemistry as good as it was. Only an 11 oz. box a day but I wouldn't be without it. ADDED NOTE They've changed the top since I last ordered and I'd like to thank whom ever made the decision to do so. The screw top is 1000% better than that old silver strip that never came off the same way twice in a row and didn't protect a partially filled box. I hope they will continue to use this screw-top packaging from now on. THANK YOU AGAIN",

All are made from concentrate and include natural flavors, which can mean absolutely anything! Finally, of the tetra product, I prefer Vita Coco (pure flavor and pineapple). ANother brand that I found to be so-so is harvest bay.

The taste is so mild (talking about the plain coconut water variety) that at first you wonder if you're just drinking water, but then comes that slight sweetness that tells you it's from a young coconut. I don't think I buy all the \"best hangover cure\" stuff, because I can't think of any reason why it should have some sort of magical properties in that regard. My best guess is that drinking one of these things before bed gives you the hydration your body sorely needs after a night of overconsumption. I would think that you'd get the same effect drinking 11.2 ounces of water, juice, or some other non-diuretic beverage, but what do I know? Regardless, these are worth the money because they are delicious, and it's a flavor you just can't get elsewhere. Vita Coco does it right too--no added sugar or nasty chemicals. And this is a great way to get Potassium for those of us who don't like bananas. I've tried all the flavors of this and I do like the ones that are mixed with fruit juice, but I keep coming back to the plain coconut water because in the other flavors the stronger fruit juice overpowers the subtle coconut flavor--and that is the best part in my opinion!",

Coconut water is so much more! I started suffering from postural hypotension (a.k.a. orthostatic hypotension) a few years ago. When I'd get up from a non-standing position, especially one where my head was at or lower than my heart level, I'd see gray spots, all gray, feel a piercing migraine, and/or loose complete control over my equilibrium and balance. That made cleaning and yoga almost perilous activities, as the unsteady, dizzy feeling felt worse than a hangover (I stopped taking yoga altogether, but I can't exactly stop cleaning!). I also would occasionally feel dizzy even if I was standing upright the whole time--with no apparent provocation. The scariest experience was when I was in an exercise class and had been in a crouching position (with a lowered head) for several minutes. When I started to get up too quickly, it literally felt like an outside force was puppeteering my body, pushing down on me, and preventing me from being able to immediately stand up. It felt like momentary possession. I later talked with a doctor about it, who said that when our brains, that three pound, all-important organ, aren't getting enough oxygenated blood, it can feel very strange and the sensation will feel differently to different people. Although the brain only weighs three pounds, it greedily commandeers 25% of the oxygenated blood supply at all times. Even slightly less than the 25% will cause fainting, as that will help the body bypass gravity and blood pressure adjustments and let the blood flow more freely to the brain. When we are in a non-standing position, blood will pool in our legs, and our blood pressure can't always adjust quickly enough to accommodate our rising posture. There is a reason I'm giving a medical back history to this review--bear with me. I thought I'd have to get on some long-term medication to treat my postural hypotension. It turns out that for some reason if I drink coconut water on a regular basis, I get far less dizzy, and the gray spots and other symptoms are far more manageable. I talked with a nurse about it, and she said that the mineral-rich coconut water can actually change the blood's viscosity, which can in turn affect blood pressure and stop the dizzying affects of postural hypotension. I have very low blood pressure (low 100s, 90s, even high 80s) and hypoglycemia, so somehow, this Wonder Drink has helped restore my balance and equilibrium to the point where I don't freak out about passing out if I'm in a non-standing position. I still do see gray spots or get a equilibrium headache at times, but not nearly to the extent that I used to before I regularly consumed coconut water. I stopped drinking the coconut water for awhile to see if the postural hypotension symptoms returned, and sure enough, they did. I hope there will be some studies to see how coconut water fares as an alternative treatment for postural/orthostatic hypotension.",

I like it for the high concentration of potassium and other electrolytes and I learned this little trick when I was a marathon runner.. The taste is good, but it tastes much more like coconut water right out of the shell than most other brands. I suppose that's because it has never gone through the concentrate state and it's totally free of added flavors. It's almost sugar free and, as such, is not sweet as are some coconut drinks. I thought it had an ever-so-slight fermented taste, which was not at all objectionable. It tastes like natural coconut water, and that's what it is.

I monitor my body's processes closely and can attribute these improvements, at least in large part, to consuming coconut water. Highly recommended! I'm on Amazon's \"Subscribe & Save\" with this product. I find that my husband and I use more of this in the summer (when we are more active outdoors) than in the winter, and Subscribe & Save allows me to add more or order less on certain shipments.",

            "review_text": "Vita Coco 100% pure coconut water is a staple in our household. It's so much healthier than sodas or sugary juices. Its only ingredient is coconut water, which is naturally high in potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorous. No artificial preservatives, colors or flavors, and no added sugar. It hydrates better than regular water or sports drinks, too. Each box has 60 calories, 35 mg sodium, 15 gms of carbs, and no fat or cholesterol. I love these 11.1 oz. long-life containers - they don't have to be refrigerated and the easy pull tab on the top makes it easy even for children to open it. It's the perfect size and travels well in a backpack or purse. The flavor of this product is as close to coconut water right out of the shell as you can get. We've drunk cases of it and never had any that had an \"off\" flavor like one reviewer had. It lasts for months on the pantry shelf, and we make sure we don't run out of it by having it delivered free with Amazon's Subscribe and Save program. I save 15% on the purchase price by subscribing to delivery. Even if you don't want to subscribe (there's no obligation after the first delivery) you can have it shipped free with SuperSaver shipping if your order totals $25 or more. I sound like a commercial as I read back over my review, but I just want potential buyers to know that this is a quality product that our family loves, and one that I feel good about serving to them.",

I have been told, and personally have experienced, that coconuts from various countries taste different. Vietnamese and Cambodian coconuts produce water that is blander, sourish and generally not as pleasant. This product tastes like that, unfortunately. If you're looking for that naturally sweet fresh(er) coconut taste, try O.N.E-- i'd recommend it over this particular brand",

There is a hint of sulfur (stronger at room temperature), presumably used as a preservative. There's mention of pulp in the drink, which I'm not fond of. I have not spotted any, but then again, the diameter of the straw I use is so small, any pulp, if present wouldn't be able to pass through. I had to use straws removed from old Capri Sun packages because, unlike competitors, the containers had no straws attached, which removes about half the convenience of the packaging. The company also listed no nutritional value information or an ingredients list under their product description (all that's listed are the \"benefits\"). The price is comparable to other brands (it becomes a great price when amazon offers a promotion). For potential buyers: Beware of planted reviews for some of the Vita Coco products, aimed at boosting the star rating. Tsk tsk.

However, I hate how it doesn't come with a straw unlike the other tetra-pack drinks. And on the picture they show a straw in a coconut. I bought 2 packs of 12, one of them (out of 24) tasted weird. It had a petroleum smell/taste to it. I drank a few sips and a few more since it was so expensive, but ended up throwing it out. Anyone else with this issue? I kinda don't want to reorder it if it gets contaminated with that kind of stuff.",

Our body loves this stuff just as much as we do...without all that fructose, sucrose, and whatchamacallit preservative additive stuff in so many products today. I love the plain coconut water as it has less calories and gives me the boost I need. Just check out the ingredient list...coconut water...that's it!!! Gee I sound like a commercial :-/. Anyway, the fact that it's low in calories and offers the potassium and electrolites we need just seals the deal for us. Oh the other thing I noticed when comparing products is vitacoco uses ACTUAL fruit puree unlike the other brand that uses fruit essence...what is fruit \"essence\" anyway??? And if you've never had coconut water, it doesn't taste like cococut meat. It's more earthy and subtle. And if you're squimish on taste and picky, I recommend my husband's favorite flavor, Pineapple. That one is coconut water with pineapple and coconut meat puree...it tastes like a refreshing PinaColda :-). He absolutely LOVES it...I do too, but it has a little more calories (110 cal) and a little fat (2.5g), whereas the plain coconut water has only 60cal and 0 fat, yes, zero :-). BTW, my husband is an avid runner who logs around 45+ miles a week and is always looking for a good drink to rehydrate and recoop after a long run. Since this stuff isn't cheap, around $1.50 a shot, he saves it for his longest runs and drinks nestle quick chocolate skim milk for his shorter runs...but the coconut water is by far his favorite treat. Besure to chill it before drinking...not very refreshing warm :-p. For the reviewer who didn't like it, feel free to send your case to us, we'll drink it :-).",

I was SO excited when I found Vita Coco at my local health food store. I drank my first container and was immediately in love. No added sugar, no added flavor, just the way I like it... like it came out of the coconut. Now, with the click of a button I buy Vita Coco online == two cases a month == and I drink one a day. (I could easily drink more, but I don't want to find myself in an intervention for addiction. :~) Thank you Vita Coco for the BEST, most delicious fresh coconut juice, easy to store, easy to open, easy to drink.

Vita Coco has changed their formula to include vitamin C, possibly to prevent the problem I had: a product that smelled and tasted like rotting fish. About half of the products contained clear liquid, and about half when you opened them contained a urine-colored product, with the white cardboard around the mouthpiece having fringed into a brownish color. Vita Coco assured me this was a normal color variation. I drank quite a few of them, and the tasted varied greatly. Some were almost as sweet as glucose syrup and I had to cut them with water. Some tasted what I would call normal. And then I came across one of the brown mouthpieced ones with urine-colored product which smelled and tasted like rotten fish. I called Vita Coco again and again was told that I should be happy that there is a color and taste variation because it indicates a natural product. I was then interrupted and asked if I had a point I was trying to make. I told the customer service agent at Vita Coco I was telling her the product tasted like rotting fish. And she responded by telling me that she liked fish. She asked me if I call a lot of companies to complain about products. I will give myself a lot of credit and say that I remained calm in spite of her continued nasty comments. She kept telling me I needed to contact Amazon to file my complaint, and I was aghast that a company that sells beverages couldn't care less that they were selling a rotten beverage. She said 99% of the time they're not. So she is trying to make me feel better by saying only 1 out of 100 of their products is rotten? She told me she had nothing more to say and had given me all my options (having given me the Amazon.com phone number). At this point, I was annoyed, and maybe this wasn't the best thing to say, but I asked if she would be contacting the FDA about this. She told me that the FDA doesn't handle natural products. She said what would they do--tell us to use different coconuts? I finally said, I just want to know that you will pass this message along, and will you contact me to update me. Normally I wouldn't care. Normally if she hadn't talked to me like she had, I would have been happy for a refund or anything, none of which was offered. I don't need to know what the company will do. But she kept sarcastically saying she was going to pass my message along, and I told her based on her attitude I didn't believe she was going to do anything. She asked for my e-mail and said if I don't hear from them in 6-8 weeks, that she *really* hopes I call back. I have worked in customer service, and I have had to put up with abuse from customers, so I never treat representatives like that. And I was nothing but polite to this person who was abusive to me. If a rotten product wasn't enough to turn me off, the rotten attitude at the company's New York office was. I don't trust this company, and they ruined their name in my eyes forever.",

The taste of the coconut water varies based on the soil and water from where it grow. I tried the so-called fresh young coconuts at various farmers market here but they all had some peculiar taste, which I never liked and never tasted like what you get in India, may be because they were imported from Thailand or a nearby island several weeks ago and may be they were grown with specific chemical to last long. The real coconut will not last more than two to three weeks. All the canned ones in farmers marker were also altered and never real coconut water. I tried one from Whole Foods, where it tasted real but not great. I bought this 12 pack from Costco for only 11.xx and it tasted much real and exactly like what I get in India. I saw this founders video in youtube where he mentioned he started this from Brazil, because they drink this next to water there, so may be this is imported from Brazil. Only one mystery is how the taste of all 12 packs I consumed were all sweet, which is not the case if you drink 12 real young coconuts in a row. Atleast couple of them will be tasteless. But for sure these never taste like added sugar and they taste real young coconut water. These are very good natural hydrates, so go get it at Costco.",

I have always appreciated the low environmental impact of your paper and foil packaging. I was greatly disheartened when my most recent shipment arrived, and I saw that the packaging now includes a plastic mouthpiece on each container. Plastic production is the number one exploiter of fossil fuels and one of the biggest contributors to environmental pollution, carbon poisoning of the atmosphere, and ultimately plastic waste that does not break down and sits in a landfill forever. I hope you will reconsider this short-sighted change to your product, think of our planet and return to a more environmentally conscious approach.

Believe it or not....... Choose the best one ...This is so far my best experience.. I can assure you that I am not being paid by the good people at Orthodox Coconut Palm Brand , but if I were, their profits would increase 1000%.

Ironically, I bought them on days when I was rushing around and didn't have time to eat. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes with my son a few years ago and noticed I can have some pretty bad crashes if I don't eat at pretty short intervals. Anyway, I had gone a few hours without eating and drank one of the packs I bought thinking nothing of it. It was about two hours after drinking the beverage that I noticed I had not eaten anything in about four or five hours. I was not hungry and my blood sugar did not take the plunge it usually takes. I was amazed. The very next day, I brought along some coconut water because I had a meeting and knew I was not going to be eating for awhile. The same thing happened. It helped me get through the meeting without crashing. Now, I cannot get through the day without having my coconut water. My favorite is the pineapple. My two year old also loves it. He says, \"Uhmm, good!\" I would rate this a 10 if I could just for what it does for my blood sugar.",

So drink up and enjoy! PS went to doctor today, I'm in middle 50's and told my bad cholestrol level is amazingly low. I drink a little of my mix every other day.

Even with subscribe and save it's 19 - which isn't so bad for the convenience. Go subscribe and save if you have Amazon Prime.",

Electrolytes can be a life saver if I get a migraine or sick from an allergy attack. When I discovered that coconut water can work in this way I determined to go buy a case at Costco. My nearest Costco carries this brand. Reading the label it says \"100% coconut water,\" but the ingredients says \"coconut water, citric acid.\" That does NOT add up to 100% coconut water. What's the big deal? For most reading this probably nothing. But if you have mold allergies, are one of the rapidly growing number of people with a corn allergy, or you wish to avoid GMO's, citric acid can be a concern. A great bulk of citric acid is manufactured by growing a mold in a medium of GMO corn. It can be difficult to find out the source of a company's citric acid. If your allergy/sensitivity to corn or mold is severe, you may have a reaction to this brand. I gave this two stars for mislabeling and to be fair, I did not try this product for reasons stated above.",

Video of the brands , and i choose Vita coco ....and for my surprise 5 days later arrived the order to my door ....and them I was ready to the flavor test with my daughter and my wife , believe it or not my daughter grow drinking coconut water and eating the pulp too , I think more often than a regular cow milk .... Now attention carefully ... I try with tree diferent brands ... So now is the turn for a child with only 4 years ... 2 and half in Cuba and 1 and half in the USA so I gave her Zico .....after O.N.E....and the last Vitacoco ...and without comments and nothing my daughter choose the same brand that I choose too ...(VITACOCO) because is the most close 99.8% to the fresh coconut taste...... So consider that a child with only 4 years old .... Believe it or not....... Choose the best one ...This is so far my. experience...and I am sorry cause my english is not perfect so I try to be as much clear and understandable possible...thanks and I hope my opinion, comments will be benefitial for everyone out there...bye .....a Cuban family..",

            "review_text": "Salutations from Kissimmee, FL. Population, 59,682. In September of 2004 I began growing and harvesting award-winning coconuts for our local 4H county fair. I take pride in all the usual aspects of coconut-growing: size, firmness, texture, taste, acidity (ph balance), half-life, color contrast, hair length, you name it. But what's a coconut without a good coconut tree? With Kissimmee's prestigious 17.32 square miles of flat, dry, barren land, it's difficult to keep those babies adequately hydrated. Even more difficult is doing this naturally. So when I learned about Vita Coco Pure Coconut Water (\"Naturally Hydrating\"), I immediately, like so many other well-meaning customers, believed I would increase my fertility, output and produce quality by tenfold, at least. I filled my water tank with about 5,000 of these little guys and began pumping it through my complex sprinkler system to water my plantation. The first thing I noticed was that it clogged up all my underground pipes. Repair cost me in the upper-mid thousands. That's a lot of green. Next, the chalky, white liquid attracted palmetto bugs and mosquitos the size of my right thumbnail. Gross. I'm still applying Gold Bond as the healing process continues. But perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this whole ordeal was when I found out I had been feeding my dear coconut trees the dead fruit of their fallen brothers and sisters. That's right. Coconut water is made FROM coconuts, not FOR them. This is modern-day cannibalism at it's finest, and it's my duty to stand here today and end this madness. I probably wouldn't even be writing this if watering my coconut trees with coconut water had WORKED, but it didn't. All my trees are dead. I'm still giving this item three stars because I had about 4,995 mini-juice boxes leftover after mourning the loss of my dear trees so I decided to drink them out of spite and to join in the suffering of my lost, beloved, livelihood. Surprisingly refreshing, and fruity. I know that's not how this product is intended to be used, but if you're as disappointed as I am and have some extra lying around after investing your entire life savings in something you thought would benefit your crops, try drinking it. It's actually not bad.",

I am not just talking about taste, but the after effects. You feel so alive drinking the natural coconut water in those tender coconut shells. I would be very interested to know what Vita Coco does before it packs it into these tetra packs...why have they hidden that part.. Consumer...caution... support coconut water the way nature has preferred it be taken...very soon we will even forgot that coconut water comes from coconut trees. Nature has provided the best protection for it (to preserve taste, and that very subtle thing in it that gets lost when you open it and put it in tetra packs). PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THESE TETRA PACKS....Don't support these companies please... Let us drink coconut water right from the shell the way nature wanted us to... It is like milk from cows...you pack it in those plastic bins and keep it for 4 weeks...all pasterized etc...and the taste is gone...real milk never lasts beyond 2 days (and once you taste milk fresh and boiled...you will never touch the milk in those plastic cans...)",

Not to mention, I think the fruit flavors of VitaCoco just help cover the bad taste. This actually wasn't so bad before I started trying the better coconut waters, so if you're happy with this - stay away from the better ones. You won't want to come back to this! This isn't god-awful, but it's definitely nowhere close to being the best coconut water on the market. Try Amy & Brian's or Taste Nirvana if you want the best, and trust me - REAL coconut waters don't need added fruit flavors; they are simply delicious on their own.",

Returning home, I've been trying each brand of coconut water, and it took a couple months to find THIS ONE!

However, I have major issue with the packaging that most of my colleagues (Naturopathic Doctors or MD's) seem to ignore. This product and 99% of the products in these kinds of packaging are lined with very thin aluminum paper like material. As a consumer we must take a stand against all products that are contaminated with aluminum and any other inorganic metals. Kids' juices are sold in aluminum lined cartoons. All sodas are sold in aluminum cans. Aluminum is very toxic and leaches out to the liquids very easily. No wonder we have massive degeneration of health now seen at the teenage level. Unless we stop buying these products the manufacturers will keep on pushing them to the consumer. Do your own investigation on hazards of heavy metals and then decide whether to buy any product that comes in aluminum or aluminum lined cartoons. Again, to make one thing clear, my objection is not on this particular supplier but ALL who market their products in aluminum contaminated packaging.",
