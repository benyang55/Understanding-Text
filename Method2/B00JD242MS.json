I find that if you let it get just a bit frozen like a soft slurpee/slushee it is really good or just very very cold will work. I have seen some ppl post very negative remarks on here & think some may be exaggerating just a bit & some may not really know what to expect from a drink like this...nothing wrong with that just dont be so dramatic about it really. One thing I have found a GREAT use for this with is Jamba Juice now sells frozen packs of it tops selling smoothies in stores now, so I like to buy my favorite Mango a go go & use the mango/peach coconut juice to blend the smoothie instead of using the apple juice that it calls for...you could use any of the vita water favors to mix with any of the flavors. Instead of hating something try mixing it with something else & finding ways to create a healthy drink. Bottom line I love it.",

I opened one of the containers and took a swig immediately as I opened the box. Ugh! The mango aftertaste in this drink is the worst of the different mango flavors. It overpowers both the coconut and peach flavors. I can't even taste the peach in the drink. I let it chill to see if the aftertaste would go away, but was not so lucky. The flavor that overpowers everything is what you get when you leave the peeled mango out in the open for a day or two. It's way past ripe going to starting to get rancid. I put several other containers in the fridge to chill. I got the same results. It's a bummer because I was looking forward to drinking it. The version with pineapple is much much better than this one. I still like the straight coconut water drink the best. It tastes just like the fresh coconuts that my family used to cut down from the palms and drink with a straw.",

I've paid as low as $13, and as high as $20, and guess what?

I saw this add on Facebook for Coconut Water and saw that it has the same amount of potassium as V-8. I bought a pack and have been drinking it for about a week. According the the reviews the pineapple seemed to be a big hit so I went with that. It tastes exactly like you would imagine a mixture of coconut and pineapple. I can't say I'm in love with it but it is 100% better than choking down the V-8. I have actually drank this every night after my workout for the hydration and potassium benefits.

When I handed them to him, he looked at me like I had gone nuts, but what he said to me after his event sold me forever. He said, \"Mom, I felt better during this race than I ever have before! I felt like I was flying, with energy to spare! I could run it all over again!\" I've decided to keep healthy fruit and nut based protein bars and coconut water around from now on! I will admit, though, that neither of my sons actually \"likes\" the taste of it. They think it tastes funny, but I figure it's because of the sugary \"electrolyte\" drinks they've become accustomed to.

Beyond that, I can't help but wonder how rum would go with it because it has such a tropical taste. It's only a matter of time until it's used in bars and clubs.

I wanted to give Amazon a try since the price of S&S was cheaper than my local Whole Foods. Unfortunately, the first and second batches I received had the same issues. Even with the screw cap. They would be a hit or miss. Some would smell like rotten fish, others would be clear and be perfectly fine. I drink these on a daily basis, and after a week both my girlfriend and I got food poisoning that required both of us to go to the ER to be put on IV's. When I contacted Vita Coco support, I got the same run around that \"We appreciate your feedback but there is nothing we can do about your shipment and you should contact the retailer.\" Thanks for standing behind your products Vita Coco. I had to contact Amazon support and they were able to refund me the amounts. I'm throwing all of these out and canceling my subscription.",

I should have known better after ordering and throwing out a couple cases of the Plain Vita-Coco coconut water. It's terrible in any flavor as it turns out. I figured out why it's so nasty - Brazilian coconuts. I threw out 2 cases of the plain, 2 cases of this flavor, 2 cases of the pineapple, and 2 of another. At $20/case that's $160 wasted. ZICO(5/5) - (Coconuts from Thailand) is by far the best-tasting coconut water ... just like out of a real coconut. I love it plain or with Mango or Passion Fruit. Naked(3/5) and O.N.E.(4/5) have too little flavor but are still drinkable and refreshing. Vita-Coco has some weird gross taste. I can't find one thing to compare it to, though. It's literally undrinkable.",

You can get crazy and have a bit of fun using them instead of Tonic or Soda water if you know what I mean. They also are full of potassium which seems to \"cure\" the morning after a bit of partying.

But I've read how healthy is it, how it helps naturally with electrolyte balance and all that, and being on diuretics for my heart, I am always low in electrolytes, even with taking supplements my doctor prescribes for me. So I decided to try this coconut water because it was flavored. I'll admit the flavor helps make it palatable, but I still don't really like it by itself. BUT I've learned that if I put it in a smoothie with fresh fruit and veggies or add it to a veggie or fruit juice, I don't really even notice it or it adds a nice sweetness that I don't mind. I've also frozen it as ice cubes and added it to smoothies that way, to make them slushy and cold. It works beautifully, adds a little flavor that regular ice cubes or water wouldn't, but still gives me all the good electrolytes I'm wanting! It's a perfect solution and the easy-open little packages are recyclable, so I pop them in our recycle bin when I'm done. Easy peasy and healthy!",

Is the coconut flavor strong? Not really. But then again this is coconut water, if you want a more in your face flavor then coconut milk is what you're after. Can you taste the pineapple? Yes, but its going to be a bright note mixed in with the mellowness of the coconut water. The best way to serve it is cold and shaken well. I stick it in the freezer until it gets slushy and then shake it hard. That way even when it starts to melt, you still have a chilled drink to sip on. As to the reviewer who said there where white bits floating in their product, I never drank from a clear container but the ingredients list does say coconut water, pineapple puree, coconut puree, and vitamin c. So the white bits can be attributed to one of those, if the expiration date is fine (and those are usually more than generous) and it doesn't smell/taste like something's rotten in Denmark than everything should be fine. It even says on the bottle that since its made from natural ingredients there may be a variation in color and taste. It did taste a bit salty when I drank my first bottle, but I don't think I shook it either. I don't think the drink is going to be for everybody, it took a couple of tries before it grew on me and the only reason I started was because I'm trying to cut out sugary drinks but not ready to drink mostly water.",

Our body loves this stuff just as much as we do...without all that fructose, sucrose, and whatchamacallit preservative additive stuff in so many products today. I love the plain coconut water as it has less calories and gives me the boost I need. Just check out the ingredient list...coconut water...that's it!!! Gee I sound like a commercial :-/. Anyway, the fact that it's low in calories and offers the potassium and electrolites we need just seals the deal for us. Oh the other thing I noticed when comparing products is vitacoco uses ACTUAL fruit puree unlike the other brand that uses fruit essence...what is fruit \"essence\" anyway??? And if you've never had coconut water, it doesn't taste like cococut meat. It's more earthy and subtle. And if you're squimish on taste and picky, I recommend my husband's favorite flavor, Pineapple. That one is coconut water with pineapple and coconut meat puree...it tastes like a refreshing PinaColda :-). He absolutely LOVES it...I do too, but it has a little more calories (110 cal) and a little fat (2.5g), whereas the plain coconut water has only 60cal and 0 fat, yes, zero :-). BTW, my husband is an avid runner who logs around 45+ miles a week and is always looking for a good drink to rehydrate and recoop after a long run. Since this stuff isn't cheap, around $1.50 a shot, he saves it for his longest runs and drinks nestle quick chocolate skim milk for his shorter runs...but the coconut water is by far his favorite treat. Besure to chill it before drinking...not very refreshing warm :-p. For the reviewer who didn't like it, feel free to send your case to us, we'll drink it :-).",
