tomorrow. I was wondering what
time would be a good time to bring
it over?
Oooh! What're you bringing me?
I'm allergic to seafood.
Sorry wrong number their little boy
is in the ICU and dying
What can I do to help?
Pray for little Noah. He is 3 and his
organs are shutting down!
I don't pray, but I'd love to help with
food, donations, etc.
Let me check with their family and
see. What is your name?
Bill.
